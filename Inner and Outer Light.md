Jonathan Brown on [El Greco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Greco): 
                     
*"each figure seems to carry its own light within or reflects the light that emanates from an unseen source".*
  
Clovio reports visiting El Greco on a summer's day while the artist was still in Rome. El Greco was sitting in a darkened room, because he found the darkness more conducive to thought than the light of the day, which disturbed his *`"inner light"`*

(*) [*`Catching the Light: The Entwined History of Light and Mind`* -- by Arthur Zajonc](http://www.amazon.es/Catching-Light-Entwined-History-Mind/dp/0195095758) helped me deciding to formally look for a light-based brain-computer interface for handicapped; but wouldn't mind any other feasible solution, "I can wait in darkness for any inner light, but better doing it after solving this puzzle"
