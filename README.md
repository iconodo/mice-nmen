theoretical interfaces/remedies outlines for disabilities/ailments

# Light-R(d?) interfaces

## I.- ... of men and mice
### Defining theoretical steps/probabilities towards:

1. `A Brain->left_mouse-click_interrupt interface` - beyond spasticity (and?) [...the actual assistive technologies](https://github.com/iconodo/mice-nmen/blob/master/A%20devices%20review.md)

    * [A Light opto/sensoring device... not yet in the disabilities market] (https://github.com/iconodo/mice-nmen/blob/master/Inner%20and%20Outer%20Light.md)
    
               VS
               
    * [A Skin galvanometric electrode sensoring device... with a precious solution already in the market ](https://github.com/iconodo/mice-nmen/blob/master/Chicken%20skin%20probing.md)
    
2. `Solving a FA (FriedReich's Ataxia) dilemma`

   * Virus vectoring of Frataxin protein synthesis message... things you try first on lab transgenic mice
   
                VS
   
   * Human recombinant frataxin infiltration at spinal ganglia... things not even the people with FA think are worth to try 
     
## II.- `... of heaven and earth`
