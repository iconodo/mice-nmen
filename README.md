theoretical interfaces/remedies schemes for handicaps/ailments

# Light-R(?) interfaces

## I.- ... of men and mice
### Defining theoretical steps/probabilities towards:

1. [A Brain-left mouse click interruption interface - click for actual mechanical adaptive technologies](https://github.com/iconodo/mice-nmen/blob/master/A%20devices%20review.md)

    * [A Light opto/sensoring device] (https://github.com/iconodo/mice-nmen/blob/master/Inner%20and%20Outer%20Light.md)
    
               VS
               
    * A Skin galvanometric electrode sensoring device
    
2. Solving a FA (FriedReich's Ataxia) dilemma

   * Virus vectoring of Frataxin protein synthesis message... things you try first on lab transgenic mice
   
                VS
   
   * Human recombinant frataxin infiltration at spinal ganglia... things not even the people with FA think are worth to try 
     
## II.- ... of heaven and earth
