# Light-R(d?) interfaces

## I.- ... of men and mice
### Stairs towards:

1. `A Brain->left_mouse-click_interrupt interface` - beyond severe spasticity... and the [actual assistive technologies](https://github.com/iconodo/mice-nmen/blob/master/A%20devices%20review.md)

    * [A future Light opto/sensoring device... lost for the disabilities market?] (https://github.com/iconodo/mice-nmen/blob/master/Inner%20and%20Outer%20Light.md)
    
               VS
               
    * [A Skin galvanometric electrode sensoring device... +found solution already in the market? ](https://github.com/iconodo/mice-nmen/blob/master/Chicken%20skin%20probing.md)
    
2. `The intricacies of FA (FriedReich's Ataxia) infiltrative solution dilemma`

   * Virus vectoring of Frataxin protein synthesis message... things you try first on lab transgenic mice
   
                VS
   
   * Human recombinant frataxin... a substance struggling to get out of the labs in healing form  
     
## II.- `... of heaven and earth`
### Or how to avoid forcing the desired caravan of solutions camel into the needle of sciences-religions dialogues:

3. `Heaven... I'm in heaven` - beyond severe "sight damaging"... and the `actual "cars not so sexy anymore" cause they all look the "toys" depicted in` [Short History of RMI HyperCars](http://www.autoblog.com/2007/01/05/a-short-history-of-the-rmi-hypercar-ultralight-vehicle-concept/)
